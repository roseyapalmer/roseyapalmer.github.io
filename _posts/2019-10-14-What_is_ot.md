Occupational Therapists believe that engaging in meaningful activities (Occupation) is central to
everyone’s health, wellbeing and personal development.
Occupational therapy can support children by making participation in everyday activities easier.
Occupational therapy seeks to identify and remove the barriers experienced by children that prevent
them reaching their full potential in ‘occupations’, commonly known as play, school work and leisure
activities.

Using a holistic approach this can be achieved by assessing how well a child is able to function in
their daily surroundings and identify the challenges. The aim of intervention is to improve the
relationship between the given task (occupation), the child’s ability level and the environment in
which they conduct the activity. This is known by OT’s as the person, environment, occupation
model (ref). The better the ‘fit’ between these three areas, the better the child is able to perform
tasks and learn new skills.

Most importantly Occupational Therapy is child-led meaning that goals are set in collaboration with
your child’s personal aspirations and goals. Intervention therefore is often delivered through
engaging fun, games and play!
